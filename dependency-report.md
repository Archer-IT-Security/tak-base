## Notes

1. Some dependencies are intentionally kept at older versions due to:
   - Binary compatibility requirements
   - Known issues with newer versions
   - Specific feature requirements

2. Spring Framework and Spring Boot versions are maintained at their current versions for stability. Major version upgrades should be planned carefully.

3. Several security-related dependencies have been updated recently:
   - PostgreSQL driver
   - Spring Security
   - Logback

## Compatibility Concerns

1. Jakarta EE Transition
   - Most Jakarta dependencies are on version 6.0.0 or higher
   - Ensure all Jakarta-related upgrades are coordinated

2. Java Version Compatibility
   - All recommended upgrades are compatible with Java 17
   - Some newer versions may require Java 17 as minimum version

## Next Steps

1. Create a test environment to validate dependency upgrades
2. Prioritize security-related updates
3. Plan for major version upgrades of core frameworks
4. Document any breaking changes during upgrades
